LotU proposes to have decisions made by the admin team up for challenge by the community. Upon request from any community member excluding admins within 2 weeks of the motion’s passing being announced. If the community then passes (a 66%) vote saying they disagree with an admin motion outlined in these or any future meeting minutes, the admin team will gather community input and re-vote that specific motion. Any already re-voted motions are not up for challenge. <br />

###### Motion-8
Votes: 6/0/0/1 <br />
LotU motions to put the following system in place with regards to removing a sitting admin from duty. Proposed are four ways of voting an admin off of the team. <br />
The server community initiates and passes (at 66%) a vote to remove an admin, and the admin team (excluding admin up for removal) also passes this vote. <br />
The server community initiates and passes (at 80%) a vote to remove an admin, at which point this decision will not be up for an admin only vote. <br />
The admins initiate a vote and pass unanimously (excluding the admin up for removal) to remove an admin, at which point this decision will not be up for a community vote. <br />
In the case that Jayne, the Team Leads (unanimously) and the community (at 80%) pass a vote to remove the entire admin team, there will be full re-elections for all admin positions. <br />
In addition to the above 4 points, if an admin is removed from their post, no further admin removal votes, involving the admin team (point 1 and 3 above), can be called until a replacement has been elected. <br />

###### Motion-9
Votes: 6/0/0/1 <br />
Joint proposal to define 3 areas of action for admins. <br />
A list of full-discretion items will be compiled. Actions on this list can be taken by any admin at any time, but will have to be logged in Discords Audit-Logs, admins text chat or both. <br />
On top of the above mentioned list, admins have the discretion to handle emergency situations when they arise however they see fit. All decisions taken in this area should be logged as described in area 1, will be discussed at the first following admin meeting and are up for potential challenge and roll-back. <br />
In the case of neither an emergency or an action being on the above mentioned list, actions should be written down on the next meetings’ agenda to be discussed and voted on. <br />
Actions taken through area 2 or 3 can be voted on to be added to the list mentioned in area 1. <br />

###### Motion-20
Votes: 6/0/0/1 <br />
GreenArrow proposes the following process in regards to creation of projects and appointing of project-leads. New projects can be proposed by community members through a google form. To start a new project requirements are to have some meta information for the project (description etc.), the discord tag of the initial project-lead as well as enough people willing to work on the project. This number can differ per-project. Submitted projects will be given a quick check over by the admin team to make sure the project does not breach ToS or server rules. In case the admins deem a submitted project is too similar to an existing project, they will direct the member submitting the project to talk to the other projects lead, depending on the outcome of this discussion the two projects will be merged, or the project will be greenlit nonetheless. After a project is greenlit, a channel and joinable role will be created, and the project-lead will be asked to post project description and instructions on how to join in the ‘billboard’-channel mentioned in [motion #19](motions.md#motion-19). <br />

###### Motion-21
Votes: 6/0/0/1 <br />
Shared motion to further detail the “meta information” for a project as mentioned in [motion #20](motions.md#motion-20). The following is proposed: <br />
The name of the project should be provided. <br />
A short description of the project should be provided. After a project is greenlit this description should be posted to the ‘billboard’-channel by the project-lead. <br />
An estimate of people required for the viability of the project should be provided. <br />
A list of discord tags of members already, or planning to be, involved with the project should be provided. This list, along with the estimate from the above point, is used by the admin team to determine viability of projects. <br />
The option is given to request either a fully public, semi-private or fully private channel for the project. Fully public channels will be open to everyone, semi private channels will be open to everyone with the project role, where the project role is joinable by any community member, fully private channels are only open to members with the project role, where the project role is given out at the project-leads discretion. Fully public or semi private channel requests will always be approved, fully private channel requests are subject to a vote by the admin team. <br />

Votes: 6/0/0/1 <br />
GreenArrow, Flaming and LotU propose the following system for approving projects. <br />
All admins will read through the submitted projects that have not been discussed yet before the weekly admin meeting. <br />
If any admin has additional questions about the projects, they’re free to invite the proposed project lead to the upcoming admin meeting. If this is done, please add a comment/note to the submission so the other admins are aware. <br />
During admin meetings all projects will be discussed. If there are no further questions they will be voted on immediately and either greenlit and kicked off or shut down, with a reason which will be communicated back to the person who submitted the project and the proposed project lead. <br />
Voting on project approval happens in accordance with  [motion #10](motions.md#motion-10) and [#11](motions.md#motion-11) with the exception that admins are not allowed to call a re-vote on project votes they were not present at. <br />
